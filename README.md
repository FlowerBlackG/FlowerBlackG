## 🥹 Noteworthy Work

### Vesper System 🖥️

This project is my undergraduate thesis project. You can think of it as a time-sharing service system, or a cloud desktop manager.

At its core is [Vesper Core](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/vesper), a Wayland desktop environment built upon wlroots. It provides a minimalist desktop environment, incorporating a built-in VNC server and administrative control interfaces. Notably, it offers high customization capabilities, allowing for operation without a physical display and customization of screen resolution and VNC manager behavior. The VNC service and administrative control service can be enabled or disabled via parameters.

To provide more convenient access and management, I developed [Vesper Center](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/vesper-center) and [Vesper Front](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/vesper-front). Vesper Center is a service manager that maintains user accounts and manages desktop environments on the system. Vesper Front is a web-based application that provides access to the system and includes a built-in VNC viewer.

[Vesper Launcher](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/vesper-launcher) is created to streamline the startup process of Vesper Core within Vesper Center. Its general-purpose design makes it suitable for various other applications.

**This system is currently supporting the Operating System course at Tongji University, serving hundreds of students each year.**

### Unix V6++ File System Editor 🗂️

A lightweight Unix V6++ file system editor written in C++ with only STL dependencies.

It replaces the decade-old C#-based editor.

**It has been integrated into the Operating System course experiment toolkit at Tongji University.**

### OneTJ Android App & Web App 🌏

A third-party client providing comprehensive access to Tongji University's academic affairs system, offering features such as course schedule viewing, exam result inquiry, CET-4/6 score check, notice reading, (previously available) course registration, exam schedule lookup, and more.

This software, initially an Android app, now offers a web application version developed with the support of Informatization Office of Tongji University.

**It's noteworthy that this project directly contributed to the establishment of [Tongji University's open platform](https://api.tongji.edu.cn), playing a significant role in the university's informationization efforts.**

Check the [Android app](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/OneTJ) and [web application](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/onetj-webapp) repositories for more details.

### Fake Run 🏃‍♀️‍➡️

A virtual location-based Android app designed to assist students in fulfilling their running check-in requirements without actually running. It offers map support for multiple schools.

You can check [this repo](https://github.com/FlowerBlackG/FakeRun) for more.

This project's map library is a collaborative effort by students from various institutions. If you have maps you'd like to add to our collection, feel free to reach out to me via email.
